# Identification and Ranking of Optimal Locations for New Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations in Dublin

## Motivation

We're tackling the challenge of identifying the best spots for new EV charging stations in Dublin, contributing to the city's eco-friendly and clean mobility goals due to the increased threat of global warming.

## Why It Matters

As the world shifts towards greener transportation options, EVs have gained prominence for their reduced emissions and environmental benefits. To support this transition, we're working on creating an optimal network of EV charging stations in Dublin, ensuring easy access for EV owners. 

## How It Works

Our approach involves data-driven decision-making and ranking functions while obtaining data from readily available sources:

### 1. Data Collection and Exploration: 
   - Existing charging station locations
   - Demographic factors
   - Traffic density
   - Proximity to amenities
   - Other features influencing charging station demand and usage patterns.

### 2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering:
   - Clean and pre-process the collected data.
   -  Calculate metrics such as:
      - Proximity to existing charging stations
      - Distance to public service spots
      - Pobal's deprivation index
      - Population density, etc.
    
### 3. Clustering and Sphere of Influence Formulation:
   - The potential hotspot locations are clustered together and the hotspot closest to the centroid of the cluster is chosen as the hotspot representative
   - Sphere of influence is a theoretical radius around the hotspot that constrains what features can be used as decision variables

### 4. Objective (Ranking) Function Formulation: 
   - Formulate an objective (weight) function that considers the various features. This function guides the optimization process to select the most suitable locations for new EV charging stations.

### 5. Results and Recommendations:
   - Based on optimization results, we identify the top spots for new EV charging stations in Dublin. This information aids policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders in strategically deploying charging infrastructure.

## Getting Started


- Install required Python packages
- Prepare your data:
   - Create a data directory and place your web-scraped or otherwise obtained CSV files inside.
   -Ensure your hotspot.csv contains potential charging station locations and features.csv lists nearby amenities.

    Open the ev_charging_optimization.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## Data Format

To ensure compatibility, your hotspot.csv and features.csv files should have the following variables (columns):

### hotspot.csv:

    Columns: location_id, latitude, longitude
    Each row represents a potential charging station location.
    Example:

    python

    location_id,latitude,longitude
    1,53.349805,-6.26031
    2,53.363186,-6.241974
    ...

### features.csv:

    Columns: location_id, amenity, distance_to_station
    Each row represents an amenity near a potential charging station.
    Example:

    python

    location_id,amenity,distance_to_station
    1,Public Service,500
    1,Caf√©,300
    2,Park,700
    ...
